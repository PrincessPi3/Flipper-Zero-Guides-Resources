# How to install the Momentum firmware
This requires a computer and a compatable browser. Most browsers except FireFox and Brave work by default.

You can always flash back to the official firmware or any other custom firmware, and you will not lose any data or files or anything by flashing.  

1. Plug Flipper into computer via USB cable
2. Open the Momentum web flasher at https://momentum-fw.dev/update/
3. Click the Connect button
4. Your browser will prompt you to select a serial device. Pick one if there are multiple and if it doesn't work, refresh the page and try another one
5. Select the dev relaease
6. Click flash!
