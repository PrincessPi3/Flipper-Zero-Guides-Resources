## LEARN BADUSB AND FIND EXISTING SCRIPTS
Dont be scared! its super duper simple!  
First, the badkb/badusb uses an enormously simple language called Duckyscript 1.0  
These scripts are compatible with the [Rubber Ducky by hak5](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky), but the rubber ducky has a proprietary version that just has more features.
